The problem described is asking whether it is possible to sort an array `A` in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation. The operation allows you to select an index `i` (1 â‰¤ i < N) and replace `A[i+1]` with `gcd(A[i], A[i+1])`, where `gcd` denotes the greatest common divisor.

In this problem, you are given multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `A`. For each test case, you need to determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the given operation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the problem:

1. Read the number of test cases, `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array, `N`.
   - Read the array `A` consisting of `N` space-separated integers.
   - Check if the array `A` is already sorted. If it is, print "YES" and move to the next test case.
   - Iterate over the array `A` from index 1 to `N-1`.
   - For each index `i`, check if `A[i]` is greater than `A[i+1]`.
   - If `A[i]` is greater than `A[i+1]`, update `A[i+1]` to `gcd(A[i], A[i+1])`.
   - Continue the loop until the entire array is traversed.
   - After the loop, check if the array `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If it is sorted, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

The sample output provided indicates whether each test case can be sorted using the given operation. In the example:
- Test case 1: The array is already sorted, so the answer is "YES".
- Test case 2: The array [1, 3, 2] can be sorted by replacing `A[2]` with `gcd(A[1], A[2])`, resulting in [1, 1, 2]. The array is now sorted, so the answer is "YES".
- Test case 3: The array [3, 2, 4, 1] cannot be sorted using the given operation. Regardless of the operations performed, the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order, so the answer is "NO".
